 ### I'm a 👩🏽‍🔬 Physics + 💻 Computer Science Student @ Uniandes!
- ✨ I love both my majors! ✨ My current interests involve gravitational-wave astrophysics, and I'm a student member of the LIGO collaboration. My main work within LIGO is for the detector characterization team. I'm also interested in using Bayesian statistics and parameter estimation to understand gravitational-waves and our Universe. I also like and have worked in High Energy Physics, Quantum Computing, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction ⚛️.
