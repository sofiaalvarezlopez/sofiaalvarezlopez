 ### I'm a Physics Ph.D. candidate @ MIT
 #### I graduated from @Uniandes (Bogotá, Colombia) with degrees in 👩🏽‍🔬  Physics and 💻  Systems and Computing Engineering.
- ✨ I love gravitational-wave astrophysics! ✨ I'm an MIT Physics graduate student working in the MIT LIGO Laboratory and the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. I'm excited about using Bayesian statistics and parameter estimation to understand gravitational-waves and the population of sources they come from in our Universe! Additionally, I do detector characterization and data calibration efforts to assist in GW searches and discoveries for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. During my undergrad, I also worked in High Energy Physics, Quantum Computing, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction ⚛️.
